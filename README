THIS IS A SMALL PROJECT MADE USING JS + PHP

MICROTRANSFER IS A SITE WHICH WILL STORE
UPLOADED FILES TEMPORARILY (6 HOURS) AND
WILL RETURN THE FILE TO THE USER, AFTER THE
USER ENTERS THE FILE'S UNIQUE CODE.

THE UPLOAD INTERFACE IS A DRAG/DROP STYLE
UPLOAD FORM, AND THE DOWNLOAD INTERFACE IS
A SINGLE TEXT INPUT

A DATABASE IS ALSO USED TO TRACK ALL OF THE
CURRENT FILES (mt)

PERFORM THE CONTINUOUS CHECKING OF ALL FILES
TO SEE WHICH ARE 6 HOURS OLD AND MUST BE
DELETED.
